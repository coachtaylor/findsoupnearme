## ❓ Common Questions

**A:** They were hurting performance and distracting from the main goal (helping users search for soup restaurants). We kept essential animations for user feedback.

**A:** It's still in your git history. You can easily revert if needed (see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for rollback plan).

### Q: Is this mobile-friendly?
**A:** Yes! The new design is mobile-first and tested on all device sizes.

### Q: How long to deploy?
**A:** 30 minutes for local testing, 1-2 hours for staging, 30 minutes for production. Total: ~2-3 hours.

### Q: Can I customize it?
**A:** Absolutely! The code is clean and well-documented. Check DESIGN_GUIDE.md for the design system.

### Q: What if something breaks?
**A:** See the troubleshooting section in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md. You can also easily rollback.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test with Real Users
Get 5-10 people to test the new design before full rollout. Their feedback is invaluable.

### Tip 2: A/B Test If Possible
Run 50/50 split between old and new for 1-2 weeks to see real metrics.

### Tip 3: Monitor Analytics
Watch these key metrics:
- Search completion rate
- City card clicks
- Restaurant detail views
- Mobile vs desktop performance

### Tip 4: Iterate Based on Data
The design is a starting point. Use data to make it even better.

### Tip 5: Keep It Simple
Resist the urge to add complexity back. Simple converts better.

## 🔌 API Integration Needed

The individual soup type pages use the `useRestaurants` hook:

```javascript
const { 
  restaurants,      // Array of restaurants
  loading,          // Loading state
  error,            // Error message
  states,           // Available states
  cities            // Available cities
} = useRestaurants({ 
  soupType: 'ramen',
  state: 'CA',
  city: 'San Francisco',
  priceRange: '$$',
  sortBy: 'rating'
});
```

**Make sure your API supports:**
- Filter by `soupType`
- Filter by `state` and `city`
- Filter by `priceRange`
- Sort by `rating` or `reviews`
